## Overview of the Implementation

The Danish Kontoplan Transaction Mapper I've created helps automatically categorize bank transactions according to the Danish chart of accounts structure. Here's what it does:

1. **Transaction Processing**
   - Reads bank transaction data (which could come from an open banking API)
   - Normalizes descriptions and formats dates
   - Identifies transaction types (income vs. expense)

2. **Mapping Methods**
   - **Rule-based mapping**: Uses keyword matching to assign transactions to kontoplan categories
   - **Machine learning mapping**: Trains a model on previously categorized transactions for improved accuracy
   - Combines both approaches for best results

3. **Reporting & Visualization**
   - Generates summary reports by kontoplan category and account
   - Creates visualizations showing spending patterns
   - Exports categorized transactions to Excel in accounting-friendly format

## Key Features

- Handles the specific structure of the Danish kontoplan
- Combines rule-based and ML approaches for better accuracy
- Includes full visualization capabilities
- Exports in formats compatible with Danish accounting practices
